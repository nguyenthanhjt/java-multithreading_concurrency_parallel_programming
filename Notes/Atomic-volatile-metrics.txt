=== Atomic Operations
An atomic operation is an operation which is performed as a single unit of work without the possibility of interference from other operations.
 The Java language specification guarantees that reading or writing a variable is an atomic operation (unless the variable is of type long or double ).
- All reference assignments are atomic
- we can get and set reference to object atomically
- Reading from and writing to the following types: are atomic operations
    + int, short, nyte, float, char, boolean
- All assignment to primitive types are safe except long and double( because of 64 bytes)
=== volatile: reading and writing to volatile variables are thread-safe and atomic
=== Metrics use cases
