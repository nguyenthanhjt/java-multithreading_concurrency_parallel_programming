======= Resource Sharing between Threads
What is resource?
    + Variables(integers, Strings...)
    + Data structure
    + File or connection handles
    + Message or work queues
    + Any objects
- Heap (shared) :
    + Objects
    + Class members
    + Static variables
- Stack(not shared)
    + Local primitive types
    + Local references
====== Why do we want to share resources?
Resource Sharing between threads is a very common problem in multi-threaded programming.

====== Atomic Operation
- An operation or a set of operations is considered atomic, if it appears to the rest of the system as if it occured at once
- Single step - "all or nothing".
- No intermediate states
